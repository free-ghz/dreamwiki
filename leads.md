## Decently well-formed

- in the future it'll be much hotter, we'll have months where it never drops below 20 at night, and at that point you could sleep outside as a mode of existence. wandering around the wasteland
    - water will be stale, infected with new bacteria and parasites, while the old ones die.
        - t-shirts commemorating the "old guard" such as the common cold, now rare
    - maybe some anti-fungal virus, dead plants no longer broken down
- how do you create a renamon?
- the rain touches the teal leaves first, the roof of the forest, and when it reaches ground it's full of the bird-cherry trees poison crystals. the soil is very sour and coarse grained, mostly stones and rotten roots, but some small plants manage to grow.
- the forest as a place where you can't die (if someone dies there they are brought back to life in a new body)
- Scientists Create Synthetic Mouse Embryos
- "offer immense promise -- but also tangible peril for those who feel they have no other option but to take the plunge into the digital unknown" (time magazine quote - don't steal it verbatim)
- pesticide harmful to "uninteresting" plants, kills entire ecosystems near farmland, bc who cares about the flowers in the groves and such? just let me grow my wheat
- plants will be forced into more of a "bio-economy" as to provide food for humans and animals
    - how is this different from what's already going on? maybe theyre sentient or smth
- KYNURENIC_ACID psychoactive, discovered in drug urine (named after)

## Empty

- find the shadow that grows - and let it inside
- fluids from planets - in the right constellations - bridges dark space... flows into the living body
- they find my mutilated body but the DNA is not human
- why wouldn't you want to nurture an alien being that slowly takes you over?
- (magic pet) bracelet ... or magic (pet bracelet)
- sottunga (small island next to Ã¥land)
- "nephelometer", a tool, redefine it.
- galatic_underworld [milky graveyard dead stars](https://phys.org/news/2022-09-milky-graveyard-dead-stars.html)
- to drink even one sip will make you bleed from the lips (but in a good way)
