## Decently well-formed

- in the future it'll be much hotter, we'll have months where it never drops below 20 at night, and at that point you could sleep outside as a mode of existence. wandering around the wasteland
    - water will be stale, infected with new bacteria and parasites, while the old ones die.
    - maybe some anti-fungal virus, dead plants no longer broken down
- how do you create a renamon?
- the rain touches the teal leaves first, the roof of the forest, and when it reaches ground it's full of the bird-cherry trees poison crystals. the soil is very sour and coarse grained, mostly stones and rotten roots, but some small plants manage to grow.
- the forest as a place where you can't die (if someone dies there they are brought back to life in a new body)

## Empty

- find the shadow that grows - and let it inside
- fluids from planets - in the right constellations - bridges dark space... flows into the living body
- they find my mutilated body but the DNA is not human
- why wouldn't you want to nurture an alien being that slowly takes you over?
