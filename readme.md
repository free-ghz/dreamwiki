welcome in the thing  
  
garden of associative thought slurry, like so:  .,.-:^¤%¶#  
combined field notes - carefully grown

colourful projector of interlinking pages or index cards or whatever. look in `book/` for examples on what they look like unprocessed

# todo
- grimes stable per row?
- 'random' should just give ya a random page instead of going through the tag system
- password protect the "transpiler" or something
- global config
  - ~~page width?~~ no, we are committed to 40. deal! ^^
  - curtain width?
  - grime pools
  - open graph stuff
  - port
  - host? do we need it?
- more alignment modes
  - centered where spaces aren't stripped so you could draw something thats 20 chars wide and it would get padded with 10 on each side regardless of if it contains whitespace or no
  - centered except the two edgemost tokens on each row are flushed to the sides to create like a pipe situation
- stats view
  - have X -> X tags where it appears as tag and link for a single page only, show as both X -> () and () -> X, as in both a tag without a link to it and a link without a receiving tag
