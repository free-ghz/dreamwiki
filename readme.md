# dreamwiki
welcome in the thing  
  
garden of associative thought slurry, like so:  .,.-:^¤%¶#  
combined field notes - carefully grown

colourful projector of interlinking pages or index cards or whatever. look in `book/` for examples on what they look like unprocessed

# todo
- cellular automata
- caps dance
- grimes stable per row?
- 'random' should just give ya a random page instead of going through the tag system
- password protect the "transpiler" or something
- global config
  - page width?
  - curtain width?
  - grime pools
  - open graph stuff
  - port
  - host? do we need it?


# bugs
- sometimes

## also
transpile should be called "commit"  
og means open graph
