garden of associative thought slurry # .,.-:^¤%¶#  
combined field notes-carefully grown

interlinking pages or index cards or whatever. look in `book/` for examples on what they look like unprocessed

# todo
- cellular automata
- caps dance
- grimes stable per row?
- 'random' should just give ya a random page instead of going through the tag system
- password protect the "transpiler" or something
- not sure if pages are made not to link to themselves (i think no?)
- not comfortable having my domain in the og tags. maybe there should be a config file or something,
- refactor page generation, because it's what i deserve

# bugs
- sometimes

## also
transpile should be called "commit"
og means open graph
