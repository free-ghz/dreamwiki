# todo
- cellular automata
- caps dance
- grimes stable per row?
- 'random' should just give ya a random page instead of going through the tag system
- password protect the "transpiler" or something
- global config
  - page width?
  - curtain width?
  - grime pools
  - open graph stuff
  - port
  - host? do we need it?
