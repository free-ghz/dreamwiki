# dreamwiki
mmm.  
  
garden of associative thought slurry # .,.-:^¤%¶#  
combined field notes-carefully grown

interlinking pages or index cards or whatever. look in `book/` for examples on what they look like unprocessed

# todo
- stats: tags by links/targets quota (where neither is zero)
- stats: pages and their ins and outs
- colours
- cellular automata
- external links (maybe do a !primer or smth)
- caps lock
- grimes stable per row?
- 'random' should just give ya a random page instead of going through the tag system

# bugs
- none that i found yet :)
