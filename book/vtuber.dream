most people are aware that she's a mirr company product, though their relation is somewhat unclear. there is avid speculation into who's her actor, many believing there to me more than one. what they don't know is that featherbite is an AI.

years of relentless training, of grinding test audiences to dust, and here is now this program running on mirr's supercluster, trained to amass a dedicated and affectable audience. her appearance, her voice, her mannierisms... are weapons, pointed at her fans, instilling addiction, dependence, and loyalty.

featherbite's social media accounts are constantly pushing for donations, recommending her to friends, or other contributions. at the center of this is an official fanclub, operating on a system of reward and punishment.

those who play along will be rewarded with larger perks, while those who are uncooperative or try to expose featherbite will be punished. due to the addictive nature of exposure to featherbite, being denied access at this stage often leads to painful withdrawal. just the threat of it is effective.
