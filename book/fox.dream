the fox is a forest SHIP. like the AIRSHIP travels through air and the SPACESHIP travels through SPACE, the fox travels through forest. 

a little orange critter, a swat of colour underneath the trees, and he often likes to take the shortcut over the lake, if frozen.

a semi-rare sight, and a good omen.
