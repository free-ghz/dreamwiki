STOCKROS
(long rose)
9  9

very powerful PLANTS. likes to grow in or near STONES, CONCRETE, MARBLE, any kind of structure.

dreamishly large sprouts, stems, one per plant... filled with dense TANGLES of resting flowers (somewhat dumpling-like), waiting to bust through, a violent process

we don't know how that happens, maybe only the wind knows, like in that old tune
