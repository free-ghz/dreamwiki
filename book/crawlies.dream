ok at this point i am ready to believe. it would be so easy to let go and start to take in water. the boat would be submerged in minutes, a small list at first but once enough sea has poured in, it would be quick. the boat on its way to the bottom. rope and bins floating.

anyway - i'm fairly certain that the spots move. they're insects or something. when i'm not looking, they shift, they crawl, they grow and shrink. they congregate

(i'm thinking, i should get a tattoo gun, draw circles around them. to show that they do indeed migrate across the skin. (or, the circles would trap them, like salt))
