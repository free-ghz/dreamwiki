växjö station is rebuilt, and the outdoor area now has a roof. it's placed roughly four and a half meters above ground, and spans the entire trainyard, bus landing zone, and surrounding parks. there's aluminum beams going west-east every eight meters or so, the rest of the structure being made of LIGHTWEIGHT bamboo plastic.

noteworthy is the hundreds of fans, there to clear out exhaust fumes from cars and buses idling under the roof searching for passengers (they would fight to get a spot close to the main building, and advertise some lucrative destination, where they would then actually go, most of the time). since the fans regulate their speed individually depending on their surrounding air quality, sometimes they accidentally harmonize.
