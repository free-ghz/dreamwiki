DELAY  delay  d9la1  3 5a9  8 92   7   8




"delay" means repetiton or likewise,
but it's mainly useless without 
FEEDBACK,
to allow the delay to eat of it's own tail, like one of those eaty SERPENTS. 
thus: it's the serpent effect!

it's to be revered as a creator of ambience and of space, if you treat it right. a somewhat more solid and slippery sibling of REVERB.
