always tears in my eyes when using the machine.

i don't think it's HORMONAL overload. there's no grief or joy as my water rolls down my face. i notice nothing until my chin is wet. wipe it off with the back of my hand. but i usually keep crying for a while.

i theorize some kind of RESONANCE in the neural interface; some saturation signal being tripped? the connection is imperfect and often induces single-sense HALLUCINATIONS. acute but hollow hunger. sand grains under my fingertips. strange tastes and scents.

and i mean, maybe it isn't to far fetched that something like that can cause autonomous reactions? dry mouth. finger spasms. opened tear ducts.
