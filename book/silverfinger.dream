 silverfinger weed

this flower has five petals, one for
each traditional SENSE (hearing, touch,
vision, smelling, tasting).

because you can't know which is which,
you mostly eat the whole plant
and ignore the senses you're not 
interested in.

the flower itself is small and yellow
and looks kinda inconsequential.
however, it has silvery hairs...
