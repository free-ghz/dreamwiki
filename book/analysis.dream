now, usually i feel good (maybe?), but this time of confusion also leads to all analyzes ending in "useless" - i was being BOTHERED by something in a SONG or movie or BOOK, so i think, how would i have done it, what is the PURPOSE of this process, what does it consist of...? and through the process more and more pieces falls off until i'm standing there with nothing.
