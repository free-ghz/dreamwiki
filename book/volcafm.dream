i don't understand this. i thought i liked fm but apparently i dont. not if it's like operating a plane in another language
maybe i dont like the fm sound

actually, i'm selling this one. fuck it. i want a beats or a kick or a base.

92 tbh 29

it sounds good this one and if yu
are an fm person
you might get some mileage here.

all i did was russian hiphop-sounding repetetive brain-boring stuff
