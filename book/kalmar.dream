i'm living with a friend and we are driving things to the extreme. i'm DRUNK three to four times a week and my DIET consists mainly of junk food.

i know the layout of the whole town, in less than a year we've been on every street at least once. there's no income. i'm dying, fast.

the actual place is beautiful, and the apartment too. i truly miss it.
