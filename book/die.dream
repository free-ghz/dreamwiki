ok this is so weird for me, hold on

i'm in a funnel, i'm in one of those speed meter things, i'm zooming through, never reaching the end

and now the wind is consciousness and the funnel is my body - when i'm inside i fail to see that i'm all the same thing, we're the same

one winter day i think year twenty eleven or maybe earlier, possibly much earlier, i walked out alone on the LAKE following a fox trail, a thin snow-covered ice, a stupid girl, and the fox wraps his tail around me, it's impossibly large, and i'm burrowed, it feels nice, and that's that
