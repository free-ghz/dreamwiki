when you smoke drip it leaves a residue tar inside the machine, which is extractable with the help of a metal rod. be wary however, that the drip tar is not as viscous as you may think... it'll quickly get on your fingers and boobs... and it's hard to get off. very sticky business indeed. most people just get rid of their machines
