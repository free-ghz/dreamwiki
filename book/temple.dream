the "temple" is a tall building in the south-east outskirts of the inner ring of the capital. it's built out of egg-gray prefab concrete, with pink and teal details (mainly metal tubes), and an abundance of glass balconies.

lower four floors hosts a clothes store (big and nondescript international chain), with's followed by fourty-something floors of apartments, laid out as a rectangular donut, with the middle open all the way down to the topmost storefloor.

at the top sits a lid of cafes, restaurants, an anarchist bookshop and a garden where you can pay to have your photo taken against the backdrop of the city. the lid is accessed by a tiny frail metal staircase spiraling up within the donut.
