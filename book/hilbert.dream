HILBERT_CURVE.

a HILBERT CURVE is a type of FRACTAL. right? hmm, how does it go. it's about scrunge. about squinking a lot of surface area down a tube.

a notable example is the CAPACITOR (electric component) where they make a kind of three dimensional metal hilbert that's then also filled with some sorta ELECTROLYTE juice. oh shit here come the cops9 988 988 988 988 8888 8888 8888 8888 87 77 87 77 766 766 766 54 43 33 33 33 33 34 45 667 667 77 78 77 78 8888 8888 8888 889 889 889 889 9ah as i was saying. we need these for continuous operation of various instruments.

(it's comforting that most circuits are still built on a deeper layer of spells and semaphores like this. physical semantics. shapes)
^ secret ^ btw, "voltage drop" over a component => heat dissipation ^
