two track sequencer with cv out for pitch, velocity and gate
and there is a trum track which has one cv trig out for eight of the sixteen pads

everything can be done via midi as well but eh. or yeah actually that's cool now because it can sync and talk to the VOLCAs

(i want to switch my VOLCA_FM for the VOLCA_BEATS hmu if you wanna)
