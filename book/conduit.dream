weird vactrol-based thing where a low time setting makes the beautiful noise we all came to hear

dial: the large time knob all left
dial: the small time knob all right
dial: feedback to maximum
dial: the "more" knob to maximum

it also makes the oscillations. you need smaller patch cables to patch these. like really small

not a very clean thing
