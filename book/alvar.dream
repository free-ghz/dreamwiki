the alvar FIELDS

from north to south, thirty odd kilometers. from west to east, four thousand meters. from topsoil to stone, a foot or two. no ROOTS can fester, no dust can linger.

here is EARTH, CLAY, and sturdy low plants. bushes frame the strip. the earth is bare in patches as large as you and me.

cross it to get to the OCEAN, or don't to stay where you are.
