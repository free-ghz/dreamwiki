dreamed i found my usb stick (that had been lost for months), woke up and realized that it was a DREAM. i sought the stick where it was in the dream, and sure enough, there i found it! then i woke up again, with the understanding that the PLACE where it was found, in REALITY does not exist. but in the late evening, i did actually find the usb stick.
