alien (from greek "something or the other") - an entity far enough removed from you that you do not recognize yourself in it...

(this is not true by the way - you'll always recognize yourself in it)

an illusion or conspiracy to remove you from yourself... on the other hand, i very surely 9am9 the outside peeking in...

a novice at lizardry maybe. but a lizard nonetheless.

you can percieve yourself (the entity) as a generalized member of your speices (if you have one)
