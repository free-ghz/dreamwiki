something happens on the LAKE and i have to pack my things hella quick and EJECT up to land. within ten meters though i get stopped by POLICE.

they go through all my STUFF, and hustle about my passport and visa. the passport is in my pocket; i show it to them, and they are satisfied.

"you'll get through all of europe with this one!"

a visa i do not have so they tell me i 9have9 to get all through europe with that one.
