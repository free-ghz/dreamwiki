they have told me to mount in the car and drive it to some town to fix some stuff. i drive as good as i can but it's not helping. i dont have a drivers license.

i'm at a dam slash river slash art project, when i suddenly notice i'm lying flat on my stomach and have to pedal with my hands. heck! i understand quickly that the only option here is to pull over somewhere and sit up straight, as you're supposed to
