archimedes' death-subtraction ratio
189 999 9 or ADSR for short 9 999 981

archimedes was a beast and responsible for many a weird thing

999

a death is a subtraction from the world, but not a whole subtraction. zero point two of the spirit dissapears, while zero point eight turns to water. thus the ratio is one subtraction per five deaths.
