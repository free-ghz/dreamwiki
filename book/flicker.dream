inside on the floor, two glowing squares of sunlight flooding in through the decorative windows. slowly making their way across the room, eventually coming across his body. like two arms reaching his stomach, and then into his ribcage, gripping something there.

fox body pressing close. its eyes opening his, asleep but staring into its pupils, into the surface of the sun.
