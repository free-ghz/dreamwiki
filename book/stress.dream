STRESS
666666

this body is stressed and i don't know why! it seems too slow for my taste? i try to numb its will but it only gets more frightened by its own existence. at this point a lot of my subconcious is just screams.

i play with the though of sedating it, but decide that it will probably backfire.

55 there is no way out 55
