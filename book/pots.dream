i love manhandling the industrial size coffee pots. i know the grip. my hands are placed where they should.

when i remove the filter, i ever so gently stroke the side of the machine. before they are pressed, i lightly circle the buttons with my finger.

and i guard it closely so that i can steal those first few drops for myself!
