# Dreamwiki VSCODE highlighting

First of all i don't really understand what i'm doing here, but that's ok.

Textmate scope names chosen less semantically and more "what looks nice with my current vscode theme, which is hopefully the default".

Not sure if i will figure out how to compile and distribute?
