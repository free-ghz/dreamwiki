# Dreamwiki VSCODE highlighting

First of all i don't really understand what i'm doing here, but that's ok.

Textmate scope names chosen less semantically and more "what looks nice with my current vscode theme, which is hopefully the default".

From `vsc-extension-quickstart.md`:

> ## Install your extension
>
> * To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
> * To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.
